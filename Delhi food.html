<p style="float:left;color:white;font-size:22" ><b>If you ask a Delhi-ite what are two things that really stand out for them about the city, it would be the rich history and the mouth-watering food. Now, I have to admit this blog sure got me in a tizzy. It's tough being born in a city which offers such a rich diversity of cuisines. Delhi is a melting pot of various cultures and races who enrich the variety of the gastronomic range in the city. From Chandni Chowk to Majnu ka Tilla, Delhi is replete with many culinary delights.<br><br>The real flavour of the Delhi street food lies in the chaat. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crispy fried bread, Dahi Bhalla, gram and tangy-salty spices. The mixture is garnished with sour home-made Indian chilly and saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yoghurt.<b></p></tr></td></table></td><td>

For the connoisseurs, there are restaurants like Karim's. For the food historians, there's a chance to taste Butter Chicken at Moti Mahal. Chandni Chowk, often called the food capital of India, is famous for its street food. The variety consists of snacks, especially chaat.<br><br>Though the number of shops in this lane has reduced - one wonders if their owners are more interested in McDonald's franchises - there still are a few left from the good old days.
