In 1200 AD, Qutb al-Din Aibak, founder of the Delhi Sultanate, started construction of the Qutb Minar. In 1220, Aibak's successor and son-in-law Iltutmish added three storeys to the tower. In 1369, lightning struck the top storey, destroying it completely. So, Firoz Shah Tughlaq carried out restoration work replacing the damaged storey with two new storey every year, made of red sandstone and white marble. Qutb Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments, which are historically connected with the tower and are part of the Qutb complex.
